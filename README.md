# ACE3_Arcade
Sometimes standard ACE can be a rough time if you're a casual player. If you like many of the ACE features but would like to tone down some of the less fun aspects of the mod, you're in the right place.

  * Enable features while a player is unconscious
  * Radio Volume (ACRE & TFAR)

ACE is a dependency, this does not modify the original ACE files.
